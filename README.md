# Weather Report Code Challenge 

**Problem :**
Please use Open Weather Data to create a single page application that has 2 sub-pages.
1. Home/landing page: It should display a list of 5 European cities (you can choose the
ones you prefer). Each city should display the city name, temperature, sunrise time
and sunset time. Clicking on this tile should open another sub-page as explained in
point #2 below. (Use routing)
2. For a clicked city, it should display temperature and sea level for the next 5 days at
9:00.
